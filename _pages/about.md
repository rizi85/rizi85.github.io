A passionate ***application security*** professional with a knack for finding vulnerabilities. As a ***red teamer*** and ***penetration tester***, I specialize in uncovering security weaknesses in web applications. My experience has honed my skills in various tools and techniques, allowing me to effectively assess and mitigate risks.

Always eager to expand my knowledge, I'm currently diving deep into the fascinating worlds of ***AI*** and ***cloud security***. I believe these emerging fields hold immense potential for the future of security, and I'm excited to learn more.
