## Exploitation

### Foothold
1. Look on the internet for the default user/pass for Fuel CMS 1.4: *admin/admin*
2. Login with default user/pass
3. Use the exploit from searchsploi: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477
4. Once you can RCE create a revshell using PentestMonkey PHP and upload it from local machine to victim using python http server
5. With file uploaded and a listener started access it from browser and get reverse shell on the machine

#### Data exfiltration
1. Get user flag from home directory: *[UserFlag]*

### Privilege escalation
1. Look into html file for content, check file *cat fuel/application/config/database.php* in the webapp structure
2. There is a password for root user on DB: *mememe*
3. `Su` on root with this password and get root access

#### Data exfiltration
1. Get root flag: *[RootFlag]*
