**Hi there!** Excited to have you along as I dive into the wild world of cybersecurity. This blog is my personal space to share all the ups, downs, and aha moments of my journey—from tackling Capture The Flag challenges to experimenting with new security projects.

Expect plenty of CTF write-ups, project insights, and whatever else catches my fancy along the way. Whether you’re just getting curious about cybersecurity or you’re deep in the trenches like me, I hope you find something here that sparks your interest.

Thanks for dropping by. Let’s get cracking and have some fun with cybersecurity!
